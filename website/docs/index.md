Net Core Genesis is not just a development framework or a boilerpate. It also includes a strong  **[Solution Generator](Using_CLI_Solution_Generator.md)** named AutoCode.

It generates runnable code and projects for both backend and UI by scaffolding.

Code Generator uses **Database-First** or **Service-First** approach. So, prepare your Database, Tables, Columns, Data Types, Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, Constraints and so on properly.

If your database or services are ready, it simply generates your backend services/methods, UI pages, validations etc. and integrates them.

When it finishes, you'll have your 70-80% of your work already coded/developed in 3-5 minutes.

[Follow instructions for a good database structure](https://netcoregenesis.com/documents/Database_Instructions_For_Proper_Code_Generation.pdf)

> We strongly recommend you to start by using [AutoCode Solution Generator](Using_CLI_Solution_Generator.md).
