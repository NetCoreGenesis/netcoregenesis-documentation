Net Core Genesis does NOT provide a monitoring tool by default.

But, for your end-to-end distributed tracing needs, [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) seems appropriate and can be suggested in terms of offering an open source choice.


### Why Jaeger?

As on-the-ground microservice practitioners are quickly realizing, the majority of operational problems that arise when moving to a distributed architecture are ultimately grounded in two areas: **networking** and **observability**. It is simply an orders of magnitude larger problem to network and debug a set of intertwined distributed services versus a single monolithic application.

### Features

Jaeger is used for monitoring and troubleshooting **microservices-based distributed systems**, including:

- Distributed context propagation
- Distributed transaction monitoring
- Root cause analysis
- Service dependency analysis
- Performance / latency optimization
