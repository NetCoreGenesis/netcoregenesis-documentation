## Copyleft and Permissive Licenses

There are two major types of open-source licenses: **copyleft** and **permissive**.

Both copyleft and permissive licenses allow developers to copy, modify, and redistribute code (derivative or otherwise) freely. The most important difference between the two, however, lies in how each approaches copyright privileges.

While permissive licenses allow developers to include their own copyright statements, copyleft licenses provide no such privilege. Instead, copyleft license rules require all derivative works to be subject to the original license. This means that developers cannot make patent or copyright claims on the original software.

The most popular permissive licenses are **MIT** and **Apache 2.0**, with **BSD** in a distant third place. The **GNU GPLv3** is the most popular copyleft license but is steadily losing market share compared to permissive licenses.
